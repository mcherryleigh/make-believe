# Make-believe
> A dreamy test data framework for NodeJS

Make-Believe is a javascript library for generating and managing test data for your software applications. 

## Alpha Version 1.x.x - Warning
**Make-Believe** is in very early development and should be considered unstable until the 2.0.0 release.
Similarly, its documentation may be unreliable in places, much of it is currently being used to solicit feedback
on an eventual stable API and set of features for the library.

## Features
* Pseudorandom value generation.
* Combine the values into entities.
* Combine entities to create batches of data or larger, more complex scenarios.
